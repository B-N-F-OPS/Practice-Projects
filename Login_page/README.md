## fun project ##

This app provides a simple login system where users can sign in, create new accounts, or reset forgotten passwords. When a user logs in, the app checks if the details exist in the database. If correct, they are rewarded with a confetti animation. If the details are missing, the user is guided to create a new account. The account creation process ensures password confirmation and gives instant feedback if passwords don’t match.

For admins, there is a delete option (i am the sole admin) that asks for confirmation before removing the database. As a stretch goal, the app includes a “Forgot Password” feature where users can retrieve their password by email and copy it to the clipboard. The goal of the app is to make account management simple, one-paged, interactive, and user-friendly.
